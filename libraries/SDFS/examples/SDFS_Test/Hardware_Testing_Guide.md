# SDFS Hardware Testing Guide

This guide provides instructions for testing the SDFS library on real hardware with a Nucleo F411RE board and SD card breakout.

## Overview

The SDFS_Test example provides comprehensive validation of the SDFS library's core functionality, including SPI communication, FatFs filesystem operations, and basic file I/O. This Phase 1 implementation contains sufficient functionality for meaningful hardware testing.

## Hardware Requirements

### Required Components
- **STM32 Nucleo F411RE** board (or compatible STM32F411 board)
- **SD card breakout board** (3.3V compatible)
- **SD card** (FAT32 formatted recommended, 32GB or smaller)
- **Jumper wires** for connections
- **USB cable** for programming and serial monitor

### SD Card Recommendations
- **Format**: FAT32 (most compatible with FatFs)
- **Size**: 32GB or smaller (for FAT32 compatibility)
- **Speed Class**: Class 4 or higher recommended
- **Type**: Standard SD or microSD with adapter

## Wiring Connections

### Nucleo F411RE Pin Configuration

The SDFS_Test example is configured to use **SPI3** peripheral with the following connections:

```
SD Card Breakout    â†’    Nucleo F411RE Pin
VCC (3.3V)          â†’    3.3V
GND                 â†’    GND
CS (Chip Select)    â†’    PD2
MOSI (Data Out)     â†’    PC12
MISO (Data In)      â†’    PC11
SCLK (Clock)        â†’    PC10
```

### Alternative Board Support

For **BlackPill F411CE** boards, the example automatically switches to **SPI1**:

```
SD Card Breakout    â†’    BlackPill F411CE Pin
VCC (3.3V)          â†’    3.3V
GND                 â†’    GND
CS (Chip Select)    â†’    PA4
MOSI (Data Out)     â†’    PA7
MISO (Data In)      â†’    PA6
SCLK (Clock)        â†’    PA5
```

### Wiring Tips
- **Power**: Use 3.3V supply (5V may damage SD cards)
- **Connections**: Keep wires short to minimize SPI timing issues
- **CS Pin**: Ensure good connection as it's critical for SPI communication
- **Pullup**: Most breakout boards have built-in pullups on necessary pins

## Testing Procedure

### 1. Hardware Setup
1. Wire SD card breakout to Nucleo F411RE as shown above
2. Insert formatted SD card into breakout board
3. Connect Nucleo to computer via USB

### 2. Software Setup
1. Open Arduino IDE 1.8.19 or use arduino-cli
2. Select board: **STMicroelectronics STM32 â†’ Nucleo-64 â†’ Nucleo F411RE**
3. Open SDFS_Test example: `File â†’ Examples â†’ SDFS â†’ SDFS_Test`
4. Upload sketch to board

### 3. Serial Monitor Testing
1. Open Serial Monitor at **115200 baud**
2. Press reset button on Nucleo board
3. Observe test output

```

### Initialization Failure
```
SDFS Test Starting...
SDFS initialization failed!
Check SD card connection and format (FAT32 recommended)
```

## Functionality Tested

### âœ… Core Operations Validated
- **SPI Communication**: Low-level SD card protocol
- **Card Detection**: Presence and compatibility check
- **Filesystem Mount**: FatFs mounting and filesystem access
- **File Creation**: Creating new files on SD card
- **File Writing**: Writing text and numeric data
- **File Reading**: Reading back written data
- **File Management**: Size queries and existence checks
- **Data Integrity**: Writeâ†’read verification
- **Error Handling**: Clear success/failure reporting

### ðŸ“‹ Not Yet Implemented (Future Phases)
- Directory operations (`mkdir`, directory listing)
- File operations (`remove`, `rename`)
- Format functionality
- Advanced timestamps
- Multiple file handling

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. "SDFS initialization failed!"
**Possible Causes:**
- Incorrect wiring (check all connections)
- SD card not inserted or faulty
- SD card format not supported (try FAT32)
- Power supply issues (ensure 3.3V)
- SPI timing issues (try shorter wires)

**Debug Steps:**
1. Verify all wiring connections
2. Try different SD card
3. Format card as FAT32 on computer
4. Check power supply voltage
5. Add delay after power-on

#### 2. "Failed to create test file"
**Possible Causes:**
- SD card write-protected
- Insufficient space on card
- Filesystem corruption
- Card compatibility issues

**Debug Steps:**
1. Check write-protect tab on SD card
2. Verify free space available
3. Reformat card as FAT32
4. Try different brand/type of card

#### 3. Serial Monitor Shows Nothing
**Possible Causes:**
- Wrong baud rate (should be 115200)
- USB cable or port issues
- Board not properly connected
- Sketch not uploaded correctly

**Debug Steps:**
1. Verify Serial Monitor baud rate
2. Try different USB cable/port
3. Re-upload sketch
4. Press reset button on board

### Hardware Debugging Tips

1. **Use Multimeter**: Verify 3.3V power supply voltage
2. **Check Continuity**: Ensure all wiring connections are solid
3. **Try Different Cards**: Test with known-good SD cards
4. **Reduce SPI Speed**: Modify `sd_spi_diskio.cpp` for slower clock if needed
5. **Add Debug Output**: Uncomment debug prints in SPI layer for detailed analysis

## Performance Expectations

### Memory Usage
- **Flash**: ~29KB (5% of STM32F411RE)
- **RAM**: ~2KB (1% of STM32F411RE)
- **Stack**: Minimal additional usage during operations

### Speed Performance
- **Initialization**: 1-3 seconds typical
- **File Creation**: <100ms per file
- **Read/Write**: Several KB/s typical for SPI mode
- **SD Card Class**: Higher class cards will be faster

### Resource Usage
- **SPI Peripheral**: Uses one SPI peripheral (SPI3 on Nucleo)
- **GPIO Pins**: Uses 4 pins (CS, MOSI, MISO, SCLK)
- **Timers**: No timers required
- **Interrupts**: No interrupts used (polling mode)

## Success Criteria

### Phase 1 Testing Goals
The hardware test is successful if:
- âœ… SD card initializes without errors
- âœ… File creation succeeds
- âœ… Data can be written to file
- âœ… Data can be read back correctly
- âœ… File size is reported accurately
- âœ… No system crashes or hangs occur

### Ready for Next Phases
If Phase 1 testing succeeds, the hardware setup is validated and ready for implementing additional phases:
- **Phase 2**: Directory operations and file management
- **Phase 3**: Advanced features (format, timestamps)
- **Phase 4**: Performance optimization and examples
