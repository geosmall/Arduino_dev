# Orginal Prompt

Our session ended unexpectedly.  We we creating a 4 part blog post series describing our (you and I) collaborative journey to develop a Linux based CI/CD pipeline for embedded systems development.  Target audience would be early career developers/engineers with some embedded development experience but new to AI tools.  You create an outline and put it in a new ./blog folder.  It was to be based on what you know of our journey, current repo state and documentation and git history. You jumped ahead (without my asking) and wrote all 4 posts, burning a decent amount of tokens in the process. You also seem to take more credit for things like establishing our overall test architecture, use of Segger tools and dual RTT/Serial debug approach. In reality I directed you to do so (I told you we could use either ST-Link or J-Link, you chose ST-Link and you reading Serial output which ended up a totally unreliable failure, I had to point you to J-Link and then directed you to use J-Run to get to reliable CI/CD execution). I then came up with the concept of team debug with me using IDE / Serial. I gave you the original repo with a working Arduino core, examples and working RTT implementation. I asked you to take an incremental approach to building out the test automation scripts and gave you hardware to use to test against as HIL. You did a great job getting that up and running. I gave you a working LittleFS library.  I asked you to develop SDFS for SD Cards using an identical interface built on top of open source FatFs. You got a scaffold in place quickly but really struggled to debug and get it working.  I pointed you to a working (on same hardware you were testing on) separate implementation that used a different interface and SdFat instead of FatFs.  I also gave you the Serial output of that example to compare your output to and see what good looked like. Finally you figured out how to initialize and get things working.  So a good bit of guiding on my part including tools to be used, working examples for RTT, SD Card / SPI use, etc.  The individual blog articles themselves are too long and go into too much detail on the actual code when the point is the CI/CD and collaborative development.  The tone is a bit too chummy, it should take a professional tone as written by an Engineering Fellow. Delete the 4 blog articles we will start over. After delete, please start with revising .blog/READme.md (only) as needed per above.
