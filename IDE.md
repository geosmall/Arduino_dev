arduino ide 1.8.19 crashes with external editor
A crash in Arduino IDE 1.8.19 when using an external editor can be caused by corrupted configuration files, software interference, or issues with how the IDE reloads externally modified files.
To resolve this, you can try several troubleshooting steps, starting with clearing the IDE's cache and configuration files, as this often fixes general crashing issues. 
Troubleshooting Steps
1. Delete Corrupted Configuration Files
A common cause for IDE instability is a corrupted package_index.json file or cache. Deleting these files forces the IDE to recreate them on the next startup. 
First, close the Arduino IDE.
Next, locate and delete the Arduino15 folder, or specifically the package_index.json file and cache folder within it.
Windows: Navigate to C:\Users\[YourUsername]\AppData\Local\Arduino15. You may need to enable "Show hidden items" in the File Explorer's "View" tab.
Mac: Navigate to /Users/[YourUsername]/Library/Arduino15.
Restart the Arduino IDE. 
2. Check for Antivirus Interference
Antivirus or security software can sometimes interfere with the IDE's file operations, leading to crashes. 
Temporarily disable your antivirus or security software.
Run the Arduino IDE with the external editor to see if the problem persists.
If this resolves the issue, re-enable your security software and add the Arduino IDE's installation folder to its "allow list" or "exceptions". 
3. General IDE and Connection Troubleshooting
If the issue continues, consider these general steps:
Reinstall the IDE: A clean reinstallation can fix underlying issues. Uninstall the Arduino IDE, then download and install the latest version.
Check for Conflicting Processes: Open your system's Task Manager (Ctrl+Alt+Del on Windows) and look for a process named LVPrcSrv.exe (related to Logitech) which has been known to conflict with the IDE. If it's running, terminate it. 
How the "Use External Editor" Feature Works in IDE 1.8.19
When you enable "Use external editor" in File > Preferences, the IDE's built-in editor becomes locked (grayed out). This feature is intended to prevent conflicts and ensure the IDE reloads the version of the file saved on the disk by your external program. You must launch your external editor manually.

This mostly works with occasional crashes.  On Ubuntu 24.  Is this a known bug?
Yes, this is a known compatibility issue between the Arduino IDE (especially older versions like 1.8.19) and Ubuntu 24.04. The crashes are likely symptoms of a deeper problem with how the IDE interacts with Ubuntu 24's updated security policies. 
The core problem stems from Ubuntu 24.04 deprecating "unprivileged user namespaces," a feature the Arduino IDE relies on for its sandboxing environment. This fundamental incompatibility can cause general instability, including the occasional crashes you are experiencing when the IDE attempts to perform file operations, such as reloading a file from an external editor.

Recommended Solution for Ubuntu 24
Search results indicate a specific fix for this issue, which involves creating a custom AppArmor profile to grant the Arduino IDE the necessary permissions. 
1. Create an AppArmor Profile
This is the preferred method as it resolves the issue without broadly disabling system security features. 
Open a terminal and create a new AppArmor configuration file using a text editor like nano or vim. The filename should correspond to the path of your Arduino executable. For example, if your executable is at /opt/arduino-1.8.19/arduino, you would run:
sudo nano /etc/apparmor.d/opt.arduino-1.8.19.arduino
Add the following content to the file, making sure the path in the profile line exactly matches your Arduino executable's location:
abi <abi/4.0>,
include <tunables/global>

profile arduino /opt/arduino-1.8.19/arduino flags=(unconfined) {
  userns,
  include if exists <local/arduino>
}
Save the file and exit the editor.
Reload AppArmor to apply the new profile:
sudo service apparmor reload
 
2. Alternative: Use the --no-sandbox Flag
A simpler, though less secure, workaround is to launch the Arduino IDE with a flag that disables the sandbox feature entirely. 
Launch the IDE from the terminal with the flag:
/path/to/your/arduino --no-sandbox
3. Other Potential Conflicts
On some Linux systems, the BRLTTY service (for braille devices) can interfere with the IDE's port access. If the above solutions don't work, you can try removing this service. 
sudo apt-get remove brltty
