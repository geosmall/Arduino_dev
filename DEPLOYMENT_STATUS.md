# Deployment Status

> **Quick Reference**: This document tracks **current progress** against [DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md](DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md).

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-25
**Current Branch:** `dev` (workspace), `ardu_ci` (Arduino_Core_STM32), `main` (BoardManagerFiles)
**Status:** Phases 1-4 Complete ✅ | Phase 5 Implemented (Untested) 🔶 | Testing Pending 📋

---

## Executive Summary

**Workspace transformation COMPLETE.** Arduino development environment successfully reorganized into a 3-tier architecture:
- **Workspace** (Arduino) - Orchestration and release management
- **Development** (Arduino_Core_STM32) - Complete robotics stack
- **Distribution** (BoardManagerFiles) - Board Manager package

v1.0.0 is live on Board Manager (created manually). Release automation script implemented and dry-run tested, but not yet validated in production. Full testing (Phase 6) remains.

## Phase Overview

| Phase | Status | Progress |
|-------|--------|----------|
| Phase 1: Consolidation | ✅ Complete | 100% |
| Phase 2: BoardManagerFiles | ✅ Complete | 100% |
| Phase 3: Initial Release (v1.0.0) | ✅ Complete | 100% |
| Phase 4: Workspace Transformation | ✅ Complete | 100% |
| Phase 5: Release Automation | 🔶 Implemented | 80% (dry-run only) |
| Phase 6: Testing | 📋 Pending | 0% |
| Phase 7: Documentation | 📋 Pending | 0% |

---

## ✅ Phase 1: Consolidation (Complete)

**Goal:** Create self-contained Arduino_Core_STM32 development repository

**Accomplished:**
- ✅ 11 libraries moved: SerialRx, IMU, ICM42688P, LittleFS, SDFS, Storage, minIniStorage, TimerPWM, libPrintf, AUnit, STM32RTC
- ✅ CI/CD infrastructure → `system/ci/` (17 scripts)
- ✅ Test suites → `tests/` (10 unit test suites, 36+ tests, 100% pass rate)
- ✅ Board configurations → `targets/` (BoardConfig system)
- ✅ Tools → `extras/` (Betaflight converter, 53 passing tests)
- ✅ Documentation → `doc/` + `CLAUDE.md` + `README.md`

**Validation:** All scripts functional, all tests passing on NUCLEO_F411RE hardware

---

## ✅ Phase 2: BoardManagerFiles (Complete)

**Goal:** Create separate distribution repository

**Accomplished:**
- ✅ Repository: https://github.com/geosmall/BoardManagerFiles
- ✅ Package index: `package_stm32_robotics_index.json`
- ✅ Installation documentation
- ✅ BSD-3-Clause license

**Result:** Clean separation between development and distribution

---

## ✅ Phase 3: Initial Release - v1.0.0 (Complete)

**Goal:** Publish first Board Manager release

**Accomplished:**
- ✅ Tag: `robo-1.0.0` on Arduino_Core_STM32
- ✅ Archive: `STM32-Robotics-1.0.0.tar.bz2` (27.4 MB)
- ✅ GitHub release with archive asset
- ✅ Package index updated (SHA-256 + size)
- ✅ Published to Board Manager

**Board Manager URL:**
```
https://github.com/geosmall/BoardManagerFiles/raw/main/package_stm32_robotics_index.json
```

**Status:** Live and installable via Arduino IDE

---

## ✅ Phase 4: Workspace Transformation (Complete)

**Goal:** Transform Arduino_dev into Claude development workspace

**Architecture Decision:** Repurpose (not deprecate) Arduino_dev as orchestration workspace managing both repositories as submodules.

**Accomplished:**
- ✅ Added BoardManagerFiles as submodule
- ✅ Removed consolidated content (moved to Arduino_Core_STM32)
- ✅ Created workspace helper scripts:
  - `update-submodules.sh` - Update both submodules to latest
  - `sync-workspace.sh` - Full workspace sync
  - `status-all.sh` - Git status for all repos
- ✅ Updated documentation (README.md, CLAUDE.md)
- ✅ Cleaned .gitignore and .gitmodules
- ✅ Updated Claude Code settings
- ✅ Moved deployment docs to workspace root

**Result:** 3-tier architecture (Workspace → Development → Distribution)

---

## 🔶 Phase 5: Release Automation (Implemented - Not Production Tested)

**Goal:** Automate future release creation

**Implemented:**
- ✅ Created `create_release.sh` in workspace root
- ✅ Features:
  - Full automation: version tag → GitHub release → package index update
  - Archive creation with automatic cleanup
  - SHA-256 checksum and file size calculation
  - GitHub release creation via `gh` CLI
  - Package index auto-update with version history
  - Cross-platform compatibility (Linux/macOS)
  - Dry-run mode for testing
  - Interactive confirmation
  - Comprehensive validation and error handling
- ✅ Dry-run tested successfully (v1.0.1 simulation)
- ✅ Documented in workspace README.md

**Not Yet Validated:**
- ❌ Actual GitHub release creation (no real release made with script)
- ❌ Real archive upload to GitHub
- ❌ Package index update in production
- ❌ End-to-end workflow verification
- ❌ Board Manager installation from script-created release

**Usage:**
```bash
./create_release.sh 1.1.0 --dry-run  # Test (validated ✅)
./create_release.sh 1.1.0             # Create release (not tested ❌)
```

**Status:** Script logic verified, production testing required in Phase 6

---

## 📋 Phase 6: Testing (Pending)

**What's Needed:**

**Release Automation Testing:**
- Create actual release with `./create_release.sh 1.0.1` (or 1.1.0)
- Verify GitHub release created correctly
- Confirm archive uploaded as release asset
- Validate package index updated with correct checksum/URL
- Verify commits pushed to both repositories

**Board Manager Testing:**
- Test Board Manager installation in Arduino IDE
- Verify example compilation from installed package
- Validate library auto-discovery
- Test that newly released version installs correctly

**CI/CD Testing:**
- Test CI/CD scripts compatibility with Board Manager installation

**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 hours (includes release automation validation)
**Blockers:** None - v1.0.0 is live, automation script ready for testing

---

## 📋 Phase 7: Documentation (Pending)

**What's Needed:**
- Final deployment status update post-testing
- Archive deployment documentation as reference
- Update external references if needed

**Estimated Effort:** 30 minutes
**Blockers:** None

## Lessons Learned

### Workspace Architecture
- Repurposing Arduino_dev as workspace was the right decision
- 3-tier architecture provides clean separation
- Helper scripts essential for submodule management
- Workspace is natural orchestration point

### Release Process
- Manual release (v1.0.0) was error-prone and time-consuming
- Automation script created to address consistency issues
- Dry-run mode critical for validating logic without making changes
- GitHub CLI integration should eliminate manual web UI steps (pending validation)

### Git Workflow
- Always commit submodule before workspace
- Workspace tracks specific submodule commits
- Use helper scripts to stay synchronized
- Cleanup artifacts before commits

### Development
- Single development repository (Arduino_Core_STM32) works well
- Libraries benefit from integrated testing
- BoardConfig enables multi-board support
- HIL testing provides confidence

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Phase 6)
1. **Test release automation**: Run `./create_release.sh 1.0.1` (or 1.1.0) for real
2. **Verify GitHub release**: Confirm release created, archive uploaded, package index updated
3. **Test Board Manager installation**: Install new release in Arduino IDE
4. **Verify example compilation**: Compile and upload examples from installed package
5. **Validate library auto-discovery**: Ensure libraries appear in IDE
6. **Document any issues or improvements**

### Short-term (Phase 7)
1. Final deployment status update
2. Archive deployment documentation
3. Update any external references

### Long-term (Ongoing - After Phase 6 Validation)
1. Use `create_release.sh` for all future releases (once validated)
2. Follow semantic versioning (X.Y.Z)
3. Always test with dry-run before actual releases
4. Maintain workspace documentation
5. Document any automation improvements discovered during testing

## Status Summary

**Phases 1-4: COMPLETE ✅ | Phase 5: IMPLEMENTED (Untested) 🔶**

The workspace is fully operational with:
- ✅ Development repository consolidated (Arduino_Core_STM32)
- ✅ Distribution repository published (BoardManagerFiles)
- ✅ v1.0.0 live on Board Manager (created manually)
- ✅ Workspace architecture implemented
- 🔶 Release automation script created (dry-run tested only)

**Critical:** Phase 5 automation script has not been validated in production. No actual release has been created with `create_release.sh` yet.

**Next:** Phase 6 testing (validate release automation + Board Manager installation) and Phase 7 documentation finalization.
